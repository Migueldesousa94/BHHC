    1. BHHC donates to the Fred Finch Youth Center, a non-profit organization that provides mental health and social services to children.
    2. I'm drawn to BHHC's commitment to new software to the worker's compensation industry.
    3. As part of a smaller team, I will enjoy making a big impact on our growth.
    4. I want to work somewhere that my work will impact millions of users.
    5. I find the Microsoft stack more appealing than other companies I have interviewed with.
