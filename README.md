My Javascript/JQuery solution to a web application project assigned to me.
The default web app displays my top 5 reasons for wanting to work at BHHC.
To complicate the app, I added a JQuery option to create a new list of anything you'd like. 
You can name the list and add an infinite amount of items to the list.
